- Renaming ecco_darwin/v05/llc270_CDR_MacroA to 3deg_CDR_MacroA

7/12/2020
- Reorganizing of directory names and structure

3/09/2020
- Migrate from CVS to Git

2/28/2020
- Adding verification experiment v4_llc270_JAMES_paper/*3deg*
  and v4_llc270_JAMES_paper/matlab/*3deg* for JAMES paper

2/24/2020
- DC: JAMES R1 setup now under /v4_llc270_JAMES_paper

1/14/2020
- Adding verification experiment v4_3deg

10/16/2019
- DC: updated calcium tracer code

10/15/2019
- DC: updated flux-conserving bin average code

09/25/2019
- DC: added matlab code folder and initial check in of flux-conserving bin average code

09/23/2019
- DC: Added calcium tracer diagnostic

09/16/2019
- DC: Updated calcium tracer code

08/29/2019
- DC: more CO2 budget cleanup

08/25/2019
- DC: added sea-ice mask for CO2 flux budget terms and
 calcium tracer for ship track simulations

08/24/2019
- DC: continued development of CO2 flux budget code

08/21/2019
- DC: updated CO2 flux budget diagnostics and code

08/15/2019
- DC: check in of revised CO2 flux budget code (development in progress)

08/15/2019
- DC: updated V3 cs510 readme

08/09/2019
- DC: cleaned up darwin_forcing.F and added code for BBL thickness file (for sediment dissolution flux)

08/06/2019
- DC: Updated non-linear dissolution code, added dissolution rate diagnostic,
  additional CO2 flux budget terms, and code for DIC/alkalinity surface forcing (for ship track simulations) 

08/05/2019
- DC: Corrected V2 apCO2 forcing grid dimensions in data.exf

07/31/19
- Added the correct V2 (hopefully) pickup files obtained from lou:~hbrix/ECCO2/darwin_ag4

07/01/19
- Moved pressure-dependent Ksp calculation used for non-linear water column and sediment 
  dissolution from dic_carbon_chem.F to darwin_forcing.F. Additionally, Water column dissolution
  is now only included when omegaC < 1. 

06/24/19
- Added non-linear water column dissolution raw late from Naviaux et al. 2019 (Marine Chemistry)
  and DIC and alkalinity flux from bottom sediments following Sulpis et al. 2018 (PNAS)

05/03/19
- To make initialization and pickups more robust:
  - remove pickupSuff from data
  - remove PTRACERS_Iter0 and PTRACERS_initialFile from data.ptracers
  - delete pickup_dic.0000000001.data so that it does not get used for
    initialization because of above changes

04/30/19
- Change iter42 pickup.0000000001.data
  For the previous "adjusted" pickup, the "adjustment" was output from an
  old build (65a?). To be consistent w/ v4 (66l), Hong generated a new one.

04/29/19
- Add v5_llc270
  Same as v4_llc270 but including river runoff from jra55-do,
  AdvScheme=33, and CHECK_SALINITY_FOR_NEGATIVE_VALUES
